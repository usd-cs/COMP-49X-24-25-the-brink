# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page reloads when you make changes.  
Lint errors, if any, are displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for further details.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your application is ready for deployment.

Refer to the section on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for additional information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you eject, it is irreversible.**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you may eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, providing full control over them. All commands except eject will continue to work, but they will reference the copied scripts so that you may modify them as necessary. At that point, you assume responsibility for further configuration.

Usage of eject is optional. The curated feature set is sufficient for small and medium deployments, and you are not required to use this feature. However, customization may become necessary as your project evolves.
