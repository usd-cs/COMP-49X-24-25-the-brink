# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was initialized using Create React App and is built with javascript and Node.js.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command starts the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

The page will automatically reload when changes are made.  
Any linting errors are displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For additional details, please refer to [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes, meaning the application is ready for deployment.

For further information, please see [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Important: Ejecting is irreversible.**

If you require more control over the build configuration, you may eject at any time.  
Ejecting removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint) into your project.  
After ejecting, all commands except `eject` continue to work but will reference the copied scripts for further customization.  
For many projects, the default configuration is sufficient; eject only if necessary.
